## Installation
Vite + React 

Go to the desired folder location
Open a terminal and run the following

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
Enter a project name and press enter (ex. my-react-app)

Select React as the framework

Then select a language, either TypeScript or JavaScript, and hit enter. (note: I will be using JavaScript)

SHORT CUT
```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
```

Navigate to the directory
```bash
cd my-react-app
```

Then install dependencies in the package.json file
```bash
 npm install
 ```

start dev 
```bash
npm run dev
```
The 
terminal will display a local URL

If you want to quit the npm run dev process
In the same terminal, you'll need to press Ctrl + C (on Windows/Linux) or Cmd + C / Ctrl + C (on macOS)
